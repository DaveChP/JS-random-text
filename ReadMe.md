#Read Me file for JS randoms library

The aim is to build a suite of JS functions for use in web development.
As needs arise, tools to solve problems will be collected together in a development library.
So far a simple tool to generate strings of random binary digits has been made. This arose from a desire to use some fake binary data as a background to a web page. This illustrates the type of things that will go in the library.
The tool under development today is a personal version of Ipsum Lorem - a dummy text generator to use to fill placeholder blocks in web pages as they are developed.
Earlier, A text file containing dummy text was written:
File name: randomText.txt
number of words: 2014
characters: 13167
sentences: 175
line-breaks: 0
sentences are closed by a full-stop (except for the last sentence, because of how the text will be used)

A copy of the original .txt file will be archived into a git repostitory before working on it as a .js file. The text file can be restored if ever needed.
